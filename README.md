                                                          **SMART MONITORING SYSTEM THROUGH AI**
**ABSTRACT:**
The Smart Monitoring System leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enable automated surveillance and monitoring in various environments, such as industrial facilities, homes, and public areas. By integrating computer vision, machine learning, and IoT devices, this system can detect anomalies, recognize faces, and monitor activities in real-time. The solution ensures efficiency, accuracy, and scalability, aiming to reduce human effort and error in monitoring tasks.


**Features**
- Real-time monitoring: Continuous surveillance with live video feeds.
- Anomaly detection: AI-powered detection of unusual activities or patterns.
- Face recognition: Identify authorized personnel or detect intruders.
- Alerts and notifications: Send alerts to users in case of detected anomalies.
- Cloud-based storage: Secure and scalable storage for video data and logs.
- Mobile and web dashboard: User-friendly interfaces to monitor the system remotely.
